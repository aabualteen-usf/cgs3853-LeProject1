    <h2>The Chosen One</h2>
    <section>
      <img src="./lebron-hs-dunk.jpg" alt="leschool">
    <p>LeBron James's high school basketball career is often regarded as one of the greatest in the history of the sport. He attended St. Vincent-St. Mary
         High School in Akron, Ohio, where he quickly established himself as a prodigious talent on the court.</p>
    <p>In his freshman year, James led the St. Vincent-St. Mary Fighting Irish to a Division III state championship and was named Ohio's Mr. Basketball. 
        Over the next three years, he continued to dominate, winning three more state championships and earning national recognition as a top high school 
        prospect.</p>
    <p>By his senior year, James was already being hailed as a future NBA star, and he lived up to the hype by averaging 31.6 points, 9.6 rebounds, and 
        4.6 assists per game. He was named Ohio's Mr. Basketball for the fourth time and was also named the Naismith High School Player of the Year,
         Gatorade National Player of the Year, and USA Today High School Player of the Year.</p>
    <p>James's high school career was marked not only by his impressive statistics and numerous accolades, but also by his poise and maturity on and 
        off the court. He handled the intense media attention and pressure with grace, and remained focused on his goals of reaching the NBA and 
        using his success to give back to his community.</p>

    <h2>Early Years in the NBA</h2>
    <section>
      <img src="./lebron-cleveland.jpeg" alt="lecavs">
    <p>LeBron James was selected by the Cleveland Cavaliers as the first overall pick in the 2003 NBA draft, straight out of high school. He immediately 
        made an impact in the league, earning the Rookie of the Year award and leading the Cavaliers to their first playoff appearance in nearly a decade
         in his second season.</p>
    <p>Over the next few years, James established himself as one of the top players in the league, earning All-Star honors and leading the Cavaliers to 
        the NBA Finals in 2007. However, despite James's impressive performances, the Cavaliers were swept by the San Antonio Spurs in the Finals.</p>
    <p>In 2010, James made the controversial decision to leave the Cavaliers and sign with the Miami Heat, where he joined fellow All-Stars Dwyane Wade 
        and Chris Bosh. The move was met with backlash from fans in Cleveland, but James went on to lead the Heat to four consecutive NBA Finals 
        appearances, winning two championships in 2012 and 2013.</p>
    <p>James returned to the Cavaliers in 2014, and in 2016, he led the team to its first ever NBA championship, coming back from a 3-1 deficit in 
        the Finals to defeat the Golden State Warriors. James's performance in the series was nothing short of spectacular, and he was named Finals 
        MVP for the third time in his career.</p>

    <h2>The Move to LA</h2>
    <section>
      <img src="./lebron-lakers.webp" alt="lelakers">
    <p>In July 2018, LeBron James signed a four-year contract with the Los Angeles Lakers, marking a new chapter in his career. The move was met with 
        excitement from Lakers fans, who had been waiting for a superstar player to bring the team back to championship contention.</p>
    <p>James's first season with the Lakers was a disappointment, as the team struggled with injuries and chemistry issues and failed to make the playoffs. 
        However, James still put up impressive numbers, averaging 27.4 points, 8.5 rebounds, and 8.3 assists per game, and passing Michael Jordan to become
         the fourth-highest scorer in NBA history.</p>
    <p>In the following seasons, the Lakers made significant changes to their roster, adding new players and a new coaching staff to help James compete 
        for another championship. In the 2019-2020 season, the team showed improvement and made the playoffs, but were eliminated in the first round by 
        the Portland Trail Blazers.</p>
    <p>James continued to play at a high level in the 2020-2021 season, despite dealing with injuries and a shortened schedule due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
         He led the Lakers to the playoffs as the seventh seed, but the team was eliminated in the first round by the Phoenix Suns.</p>
    <p>Despite the disappointing finishes in his first few seasons with the Lakers, James remains committed to the team and determined to bring another
         championship to Los Angeles.</p>
